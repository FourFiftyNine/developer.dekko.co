<h3>Introduction</h3>
Dekko provides a plug in framework for building location aware applications. With Dekko you can build applications that are sensitive to real world features such as obstructions, geometry, terrain features. Games can take advantage of real world conditions. We provide our tool chain in a number of different ways - as an iOS SDK, as a Unity Package and as a web interface.
<p>
We provide [tracking], [mesh generation], [user accounts] and [analytics] in one of 3 ways.

<h3>Dekko Unity Package</h3>

Our unity module builds on top of our SDK to provide 3d mesh support for unity. These meshes can interact with game physics.

<h3>Dekko SDK</h3>

The Dekko SDK is the best way to support physical and natural interaction with augmented reality.

Our SDK insulates you from dealing with the API directly. It provides a link library with header files and public method interfaces to invoke Dekko features such as determining feature scale of real world features and 3d mesh generation of the real world. We support SLAM ( Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and also do sensor fusion using inertial sensors to determine feature scale.

<h3>Dekko Web API</h3>

Our web api can be used directly or you can use our SDK. The Web API converts a set of images into a 3d model. You can feed it raw images o
r a list of key features recognized by FAST for example. You can also get analytics data on users and their activity in your app.
